# AirLLM Requirements for AMD ROCm
# 
# This file contains the dependencies needed to run AirLLM with AMD ROCm support.
# 
# Installation Instructions:
# 1. First, install ROCm following AMD's official guide: https://rocm.docs.amd.com/
# 2. Install PyTorch with ROCm support:
#    pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm5.7
# 3. Then install these requirements:
#    pip install -r requirements-rocm.txt

# ROCm-compatible compression library
# Note: For ROCm, you may need to build bitsandbytes from source or use a ROCm-compatible fork
# Standard bitsandbytes may not work with ROCm. Consider alternatives:
# - Build from source with ROCm support
# - Use a community fork like: pip install git+https://github.com/arlo-phoenix/bitsandbytes-rocm-5.6.git
# For now, we include the standard version, but users should be aware of compatibility issues
bitsandbytes==0.39.0  # May require ROCm-specific build

# Additional utilities
safetensors>=0.3.0
huggingface-hub>=0.16.0
optimum>=1.12.0

# Development dependencies (optional)
pytest>=7.0.0  # For running tests
