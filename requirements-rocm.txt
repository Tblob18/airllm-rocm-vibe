# AirLLM Requirements for AMD ROCm
# 
# This file contains the dependencies needed to run AirLLM with AMD ROCm support.
# 
# Installation Instructions:
# 1. First, install ROCm following AMD's official guide: https://rocm.docs.amd.com/
# 2. Install PyTorch with ROCm support:
#    pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm5.7
# 3. Then install these requirements:
#    pip install -r requirements-rocm.txt

# Core dependencies (compatible versions)
transformers @ git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git
peft>=0.7.0
accelerate>=0.25.0
einops==0.6.1
evaluate==0.4.0
scikit-learn==1.2.2
sentencepiece==0.1.99
wandb==0.15.3

# ROCm-compatible compression library
# NOTE: Standard bitsandbytes does NOT support ROCm. You have two options:
# 
# Option 1 (Recommended): Skip compression for now
#   Simply don't install bitsandbytes and avoid using compression='4bit' or '8bit'
#
# Option 2: Use a ROCm-compatible fork (experimental)
#   pip install git+https://github.com/arlo-phoenix/bitsandbytes-rocm-5.6.git
#
# The line below is commented out as it won't work with ROCm:
# bitsandbytes==0.39.0  # DOES NOT WORK WITH ROCM - See options above

# Additional utilities
safetensors>=0.3.0
huggingface-hub>=0.16.0
optimum>=1.12.0

# Development dependencies (optional)
pytest>=7.0.0  # For running tests
